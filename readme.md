food-yah
=========

Food-Yah is fork of HackSpots. It lists and maps food spots within Oxford, United Kingdom. 

Food-yah uses 'Sheetsee.js' to fetch and display all the items/places that have been populated in this google spreadsheet. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsWFYZAWY0_SdENhNVZ5OE1lc3lwME1tamw1VVpzbVE&usp=drive_web#gid=0 

I've manually populated the database, but feel free to add or make amendments or corrections to any of the data.
